## Abstract


## Background


## Motivation


## Design

- [x] Media as URI (which can be attachments distributed with Storm or usual URLs)
- [x] Small media ("previews" if given together with large media)
- [x] Fraction of assets
- [x] Engravings
- [x] Reserves
- [x] Possible decentralized issue


## Specification

Interface specification is the following Contractum code:

```haskell
-- # Defining main data structures

data ItemsCount :: U32

-- each collectible item is unique and must have an id
data TokenId :: U32

-- Collectibles are owned in fractions of a single item; here the owned
-- fraction means `1/F`. Ownership of the full item is specified `F=1`;
-- half of an item as `F=2` etc.
data OwnedFraction :: U64

-- allocation of a single token or its fraction to some transaction output
data Allocation :: TokenId, OwnedFraction

data EngravingData :: 
    appliedTo TokenId, 
    content EmbeddedMedia

data EmbeddedMedia ::
    type RGBTypes.MediaType,
    data [Byte]

data Attachment ::
    type RGBTypes.MediaType,
    digest: [U8 ^ 32] -- this can be any type of 32-byte hash, like SHA256(d), BLACKE3 etc

data TokenData ::
    id TokenId,
    ticker RGBTypes.Ticker?,
    name RGBTypes.Name?,
    details RGBTypes.Details?,
    -- always-embedded preview media < 64kb
    preview EmbeddedMedia?,
    -- external media which is the main media for the token
    media Attachment?,
    attachments { U8 -> ^ ..20 Attachment } -- auxiliary attachments by type (up to 20 attachments)
    -- output containing locked bitcoins; how reserves are proved is a matter
    -- of a specific schema implementation
    reserves RGBTypes.PoR? 

 -- each attachment type is a mapping from attachment id 
 -- (used as `Token.attachments` keys) to a short Ascii string
 -- verbally explaining the type of the attachment for the UI
 -- (like "sample" etc).
data AttachmentType :: 
    id U8, 
    description [Ascii ^ 1..20]

interface RGB21
    global name :: RGBTypes.AssetNaming
    
    -- Contract text is separated from the name since it must not be
    -- changeable by the issuer.
    global terms :: RGBTypes.RicardianContract

    -- Data for all issued tokens
    global tokensData+ :: TokenData
    global engravingData+ :: EngravingData
    global isFractional :: Bool
    global attachmentTypes+ :: AttachmentType

    -- Right to do a secondary (post-genesis) issue
    owned inflationAllowance* :: RGBTypes.Amount
    -- Right to update asset name
    owned updateRight?

    -- Ownership right over assets
    owned assetOwner+ :: Allocation

    genesis       -> name
                   , terms,
                   , reserves PoR*
                   , tokens tokenData+
                   , assetOwner+
                   , inflationAllowance*
                   , updateRight?
                  !! invalidProof(RGBTypes.PoR)
                   | insufficientReserves

    op Transfer    :: previous assetOwner+, 
                   -> beneficiaries assetOwner+
                   !! -- options for operation failure:
                      inequalFractions(TokenId)
                    | nonFractionalToken

    op? TransferEngrave :: previous assetOwner+ 
                    , engravingData  
                   -> beneficiaries assetOwner+
                   !! -- options for operation failure:
                      inequalFractions(TokenId)
                    | nonFractionalToken
                    | nonEngravableToken

    op? Issue      :: used inflationAllowance
                    , newTokens tokenData+
                    , reserves RGBTypes.PoR*
                    , newAttachmentTypes attachmentType*
                   -> future inflationAllowance
                    , beneficiaries assetOwners+
                   !! invalidReserves(RGBTypes.PoR)
                    | insufficientAllowance
                    | insufficientReserves

    op? Rename     :: used updateRight
                   -> future updateRight?
                    , new name
