## Abstract

The standard defines a way to commit to a multiple independent messages with a single digest such that the fact of
each particular commitment and a protocol under which the commitment is made may be proven without exposing the 
information about the other messages and used protocols.


## Background and Motivation

LNPBP-3 defines a standard for embedding cryptographic commitment into bitcoin transaction in a deterministic provable 
way [2]. The standard is based on LNPBP-1 public key tweaking procedure [1], which prevents multiple commitments inside 
a tweak. However it is possible that some protocol may require to commit to a number of messages within a single 
transaction and public key with the requirement that some dedicated information from this messages (like the message 
type) should be unique across the whole message set. For instance, this is required for state updates, where the updates 
are separated into different blocks (messages) and kept private, such that a single party will know information about a 
single update and should not be exposed any information about the rest. However, in such a case, there should be a proof 
that other state updates does not affect the state of the analyzed update, excluding state collisions. In such a setup, 
each state may be assigned a unique integer identifier (like cryptographic digest) and a special form of zero-knowledge 
proof should be utilized to proof the fact that all of the states are different without exposing the actual state ids. 
While this is impossible at the level of LNPBP-3 & LNPBP-1 standards, the current proposal defines a procedure for 
structuring multiple independent messages in a privacy-preserving (zero-knowledge) way, allowing that some properties of 
the committed messages may be proven in a zero-knowledge way, i.e. without revealing any information about the the 
source messages or the properties themselves.


## Design

The protocol follows dea of Bloom filters [5], which are already used for keeping confidentiality of the information 
requested from Bitcoin Core by SPV clients [6].

Multiple commitments under different protocols are identified with a unique per-protocol 32-byte identifiers (like tagged
hashes of protocol name and/or characteristic parameters) and serialized into a 32-byte slots within `N * 32` byte buffer
such as `N >> M`, where `M` is the number of the individual commitments. The rest of slots are filled with random data
deterministically generated from a single entropy source. The position `n` for a commitment with the identifier `id`
is computed as `n = id mod N`, guaranteeing that no two commitments under the same protocol with a given `id` may be
simultaneously present.

      Protocol-1 -+                                 Protocol-2 -+
  MSG-1   |       V                             MSG-2   |       V
    V     V     Id-1                              V     V     Id-2
[Tagged SHA256]   V                           [Tagged SHA256]   V
       |       [mod 3]                               |       [mod 3]
       |          V                                  |          V
       V          1                                  V          3

## Specification

### Commitment

For a given set of `M` messages `msg1`..`msgM` under protocols with corresponding unique ids `id`..`idM` the commitment
procedure runs as follows:
1. Pick a 32-bytes of entropy from uniform entropy source (like the same which is used for generating private keys)
   and compute SHA256-tagged hash according to BIP-340 tagged hash procedure [4] with prefix `LNPBP4:random`.
2. Generate a corresponding public key on Secp256k1 elliptic curve (`R`) and compute it's 256-bit bitcoin hash 
   (`HASH256(R)`).
3. Pick a number `N >> M`, for instance `N = M * 2` and allocate `32 * N` byte buffer.
4. For each of the messages:
   - create a corresponding cryptographic commitment `cI` according to the per-message protocol,
   - compute it's BIP-340 tagged hash [4] using the value of the protocol id `idI` as the protocol-specific tag,
   - compute `n = idI mod N`,
   - if the slot `n` is not used, serialize a `cI` hash into it using bitcoin-style hash serialization format;
     otherwise go to step 3 and generate a new `N' >> N`.
5. For each of the slots that remain empty (the slot number is represented by `j`):
   - tweak public key `R` with it's own hash `H(R)` `j` times: `Rj = R + J * H(R) * G)`
   - compute a 256-bit bitcoin hash of `Rj` and serialize it into the slot `j` using bitcoin-style hash serialization 
     format.
6. Compute commitment to the resulting buffer with LNPBP-1, LNPBP-2 or other protocol using `LNPBP4` as the 
   protocol-specific tag.

### Partial reveal

A party needing to reveal the proofs for the commitment to the message `msgA` under this scheme and conceal the rest
of the messages and protocols participating in the commitment has to publish the following data:
1. A source of the message `msgA` and information about it's protocol with id `idA`.
2. A full byte sequence of the buffer resulting from the step 5 of the [commitment procedure](#commitment).

### Reveal with full disclosure

A party needing to reveal the proofs for all commitments to all of the messages and also prove that there were no
other commitments made must publish the following data:
1. A source of the messages `msg1`..`msgM` and information about their protocols with id `id1`..`idM`.
2. A full byte sequence of the buffer resulting from the step 5 of the [commitment procedure](#commitment).
3. An original public key `R` from the step 2 of the [commitment procedure](#commitment).

### Per-message verification

A party provided with the data from the [partial reveal procedure](#partial-reveal) and wishing to verify the commitment
to the message MUST use the following procedure:
1. Compute `n = idA mod N`, where `idA` is the message-specific protocol id and `N` is the length of the commitment
   buffer in bytes divided on 32.
2. Compute commitment to the message by following the procedure from the step 3 of the [commitment scheme](#commitment)
3. Verify that the resulting 32-bit commitment is equal to the commitment stored in `n`'s 32-byte slot of the commitment
   buffer; fail verification otherwise.

### Verification of the full disclosure

A party provided with the data from the [reveal with full disclosure procedure](#reveal-with-full-disclosure) may verify
that the provided commitment buffer contains only commitment to the provided messages (and no other commitments) by
allocating a new empty (all bytes set to `0x00`) commitment buffer of the same length as the revealed commitment buffer, 
and re-running steps 4-6 from the [commitment procedure](#commitment). If the new buffer match per-byte the revealed 
commitment buffer, then the verification succeeded; otherwise it has failed.
